# Feature Listing

# ## Quantum Systems
# ### Some Basic Systems
* Building a hamiltonian

Annihilation, creation, number operators
[Link to operators]

Build single qubit system from paper
Build two qubit system from paper
Build multilevel_transmon example from QC docs
Build three qubit system from paper
Build Cat system (TODO: (aaron) write about this)

# ### Time-dependent Systems
Example of defining hamiltonian as lambda,
shortcuts for carrier waves and offets -> special constructor
for time-dependent systems

# ### Open Systems
From PQO can rip example

# ### Composite systems
From PQO can rip example - fix up wording? (TODO (andy) review wording)

# ## Basic Quantum System operations
# ### Internal representations: isomorphisms (state, operator, density matrices, dynamics, etc.
# #### Isomorphisms
Explain its effect on the interface for users
** DETAILS: for those who want to know more, we can link to the PQO docs
# #### Gates
* PQO Gates consts
# #### Operators
* Annihilation, creation, number
* Ladder operators
* Displacement, squeezing, etc.
* Pauli operators

# ### Drift vs. drive

# ### Rollouts & fidelities
# ### Reachability tests
